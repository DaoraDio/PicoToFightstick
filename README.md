# Raspberry Pi Pico Arcade Stick PCB ðŸŽ®
This repository contains the design files for a custom Raspberry Pi Pico breakout PCB, specifically designed for arcade sticks. The board simplifies wiring and connections by breaking out the Picoâ€™s GPIO pins while using standardized elements like screw terminals and a 20-pin connector, making it easy to integrate into arcade controller builds.
